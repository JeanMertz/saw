====

`saw` is a command line tool for shredding Amazon CloudWatch logs.

Installation
------------

### Mac OS X (homebrew)

```sh
brew tap TylerBrock/saw
brew install saw
```

### Linux (Arch Linux)

```sh
pacaur -S saw
# OR
trizen -S saw
```

### Linux (binary)

#### Redhat Based Distributions (Fedora/RHEL/CentOS/Amazon Linux)
```sh
rpm -i <link_to_rpm_you_need_from_releases>
```

#### Debian Based Distributions (Debian/Ubuntu)
```sh
wget <link_to_deb_you_need_from_releases>
sudo dpkg -i <the_deb_name>
```

#### Builds

We publish pre-built binaries as well as debs and rpms for the following OS:
 - Darwin (Mac OS X)
 - Linux
 - FreeBSD

On these platforms:
 - amd64 (64 bit x86)
 - armv6 (32 bit ARM v6)
 - armv7 (32 bit ARM v7)
 - arm64 (64 bit ARM v8)

Currently we don't publish any 32-bit or Windows builds. If this causes hardship, let me know.

I don't think saw works in the Windows terminal emulator as is.

Usage
-----

- Basic
    ```sh
    # Get list of log groups
    saw groups

    # Get list of streams for production log group
    saw streams production
    ```

- Watch
    ```sh
    # Watch production log group
    saw watch production

    # Watch production log group streams for api
    saw watch production --prefix api

    # Watch production log group streams for api and filter for "error"
    saw watch production --prefix api --filter error
    ```

Features
--------

- Colorized output that can be formatted in various ways
    - `--expand` Explode JSON objects using indenting
    - `--rawString` Print JSON strings instead of escaping ("\n", ...)
    - `--invert` Invert white colors to black for light color schemes
    - `--no-color` Disable color output entirely

- Filter logs using CloudWatch patterns
    - `--filter foo` Filter logs for the text "foo"

- Watch aggregated interleaved streams across a log group
    - `saw watch production` Stream logs from production log group
    - `saw watch production --prefix api` Stream logs from production log group with prefix "api"
